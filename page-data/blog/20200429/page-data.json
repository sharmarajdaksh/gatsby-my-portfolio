I learned about Gatsby and I thought, yeah why not? I started learning about working with Gatsby and I created this website, to have something to perhaps show on my resume. However, now that this website is pretty much complete, what do I do with it? </p>\n<p>I plan to write. I plan to share cool stuff I do and that I learn in my journey to become a better developer. I plan to write about things that intrigue me, new things that I'm trying to learn about, and maybe try to teach readers some techniques that I discover. What interests me? If you hadn't already guessed from my homepage, pretty much everything. Frontend technologies, Backend technologies, DevOps techniques, new system design principles, everything. </p>\n<p>Soon, I plan to describe the process of how I developed this website and I believe anyone looking to create and host their website online (completely for free!) could benefit from learning about it. I might also delve into Gridsome, which is, basically, the VueJS alternative for Gatsby. Look out for that too.</p>\n<p>Have any ideas for what I could write about? Reach out to me over <strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharmarajdaksh/\">LinkedIn</a></strong> or email me at sharmarajdaksh@gmail.com. To learn what technologies I have interest in, perhaps a look around my <strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharmarajdaksh/\">LinkedIn</a></strong> could help.</p>\n<p>That's it for now. Hang around for more content, coming soon.
